It is shown that the natural connectivity can be derived mathematically from the graph spectrum as an average eigenvalue and that it changes strictly monotonically with the addition or deletion of edges. By comparing the natural connectivity with other typical robustness measures within a scenario of edge elimination, it is demonstrated that the natural connectivity has an acute discrimination which agrees with our intuition.}

abstract = {The existence of a scaling between the principal  eigenvector and the subgraph centrality of a complex network indicates that  the network has “good expansion” (GE) properties. GE is the important but  counterintuitive property of being both sparsely populated and highly  connected. We have detected GE properties in half of the 16 real-world  networks studied, which include communication, information and biological  networks. Most of social networks studied do not show GE properties as a  consequence of the existence of communities with low number of  inter-community links. However, the majority of food webs represent  ecosystems that are not composed of separate communities with low  interconnections among them and possess GE properties.}

The method does not require path enumeration and is not limited to the shortest paths or geodesies. We apply this measure to two examples: a network of homosexual men diagnosed with AIDS, and observations on a colony of baboons. Comparisons are made with “betweenness” and “closeness” centrality measures. The processes by which structural changes in networks occur over time are also discussed.}

abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.}
